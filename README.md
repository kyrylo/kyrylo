## Hey there 👋

I've had my fair share of ups and downs in the professional world. Getting laid off not once, but twice within a few months was a wake-up call. It made me realize that I want to be the captain of my own ship.

### I am hacking on these projects:

- 🐛 [Telebugs](https://telebugs.com) &middot; track errors
- ☕️ [Coffee World Rush](https://coffeeworldrush.com) &middot; drink coffee
- 🍵 [Matcharoo](https://matcharoo.app) &middot; learn words

I post on X daily about my journey: [@kyrylosilin](https://x.com/kyrylosilin)

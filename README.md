### Hi there 👋

That's how it all started.

Right here, on GitHub, my career took a pivot from zero to becoming someone.

Not as a part of their team, but as an individual open-source collaborator.

To skip all the details, I'll tell you that...

I am working on [Synonym Sprint](https://synonymsprint.com), a mobile app for learning new English words. I use Rails and Turbo Native.

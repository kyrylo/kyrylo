## Hey there üëã

I'm Kyrylo, the creator of [Telebugs](https://telebugs.com).

Error monitoring tools are essential for developers to catch and fix bugs before they reach users.

I'm no stranger to this problem. I've been an [intern at Bugsnag](https://github.com/bugsnag/bugsnag-ruby/commits?author=kyrylo), and I've [worked for years at Airbrake](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake-ruby/commits?author=kyrylo).<br>
I've seen it all firsthand.

However, many popular tools have become **bloated** over the years. As a result, they have become **expensive** and hard to use.

That's why I created Telebugs.

I've always had a vision for a simple, reliable, and affordable error monitoring tool that focuses on the essentials. **Telebugs is the realization of that vision**.

As a Telegram user for over 10 years, I know how **powerful and reliable** the platform is. That's why I chose Telegram as the foundation for Telebugs.

I'm excited to share [Telebugs](https://telebugs.com) with you. I hope you'll find it as useful as I do.

Best regards,<br>
Kyrylo ([@kyrylosilin](https://x.com/kyrylosilin))

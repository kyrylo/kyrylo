### Hi there 👋

That's how it all started.

Right here, on GitHub, my career took a pivot from zero to becoming someone.

Not as a part of their team, but as an individual open-source collaborator.

To skip all the details, I'll tell you that...

I am working on these projects:

- ☕️ [Coffee World Rush](https://coffeeworldrush.com) (track coffee intake)
- 🍵 [Matcharoo](https://matcharoo.app) (learn new words)
